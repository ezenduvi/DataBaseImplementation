#  Database Implementation Project

## Overview

The goal of this project is to apply database management techniques in a real-world scenario.

## Project Phases

The project is structured into three phases:

### Phase 1: Data Collection and Database Creation
- **Objective**: Gather real-world data from a publicly available source and create a database.
- **Dataset Requirements**: Must consist of at least 16 GB of data to ensure the effectiveness of database techniques.

### Phase 2: Query Implementation
- **Objective**: Develop and implement a series of complex and meaningful queries using SQL functionalities such as `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, and aggregate functions.

### Phase 3: Query Optimization and Analysis
- **Objective**: Optimize and analyze the queries created in Phase 2 using optimization techniques.
- **Deliverable**: A comprehensive project report including:
  - **Introduction**: Overview of the dataset, reasoning for its selection, and a preview of results.
  - **Data**: Detailed description of the dataset (e.g., rows, columns, data types, source, size).
  - **Experiments**: Explanation of the techniques implemented, including indexing.
  - **Analysis**: Results of the experiments.
  - **Discussion**: Additional insights or observations.
  - **References**: Citations for any external works, including a link to the dataset.
